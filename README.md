Purpose
---------------

Solving shortest path (related) problems is the main goal. GraphHopper is a routing engine which
makes implementing arbitrary shortest path problems in Java easier and much more memory efficient than
a naive implementation.
GraphHopper is tuned for road networks at the moment but can be useful for public transport problems in
the future as well.

Features
---------------

 * 100% Java
 * 100% Open Source via Apache License (=> business friendly)
 * Memory efficient (=> suited for big data)
 * Easy to use and small library with only a few dependencies
 * Latest algorithms and highly tuned to be very fast
 * Heavily tested

Routing Usage
---------------

The following command will make a part of Germany routable:

> cd core; ./run.sh unterfranken

  1. it downloads 40MB, unzips it to 450MB and creates road-files for graphhopper (40MB)
  2. it builds graphhopper
  3. and runs some shortest path queries on it

When executing the command again, then the existing graphhopper road-files and jars will be used. So, the UI should pop up fast (~2 seconds).
After the UI popped up you can drag to move the map or scroll to zoom like in ordinary maps apps.
Click once to select a departure and another click to select the destination.
Then a route should pop up like in this SHINY ;) image ![from twitter](http://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/graphhopper.png)

If you want to import full Germany do:

> cd core; ./run.sh germany

 1. For Germany it takes approx 25 minutes for the import and roughly 1 minute for the ugly&slow UI to pop up.
 2. At the moment the UI is a bit rough and simple so, don't click or drag too much as it takes some time for this large road network
